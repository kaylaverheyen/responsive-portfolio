      <p class="bio">	Hello, Kayla here! Welcome to my first very own website. I’m very new to coding and everything surrounding it, but very excited to embark on this challenging new journey. Here’s a few fun facts about me: I love biking and try to bike everywhere, well as much as the weather allows it! My favorite thing to do is go to new restaurants and try new foods, which can be expensive but always enjoyable. Lastly, I love to travel and hope to one day live abroad for a bit. </p>

    <p class="bio">Please browse through each page to check out my projects! If you have any questions, comments, concerns, business inquiries, tips and tricks please feel free to add them on my contact page. I would love to hear it all! I’ll continue to update these pages as I continue to build, expand and learn more about the fascinating world of coding. Thanks for visiting and always check back for updates! </p>
